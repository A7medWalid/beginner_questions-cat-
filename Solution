Define mean, median, and mode. Give a real-world example of when each would be the most appropriate measure of central tendency?

mean: It is the arithmetic mean (the sum of the values / their number) we usually use with calculations and numbers to calculate the general average, for example when you want to calculate the average scores of engineering students in Control 1, for example
median: It is the value in the middle of the data ranking, whether ascending or descending, and is usually used when there are abnormal or varying values, for example: if you want to analyze the prices of clothes and the prices are different according to the brand and the material, this will cause a disparity in prices, so the best option is to use the median.
mode: is the most frequent value in the dataset, We use it when we want to know the most common value, example: If you have a clothing store and want to know the best-selling type.


Explain the concept of variance and standard deviation. How are they related?

Variance: Calculates the relationship between the spread or spacing of values in the data for the mean.
Standard deviation: It is also used to determine the spread of values from the mean but in an easier way.
the relation between them: Standard deviation is the square root of variance.


What do you know about Left and right skewness? And what happens to mean, median and mode in each case?

In left-wing deviation: the mode is higher than the median and the median is higher than the mean.
In the right deviation: the mean is higher than the median and the median is higher than the mode


What do you know about outliers? Give a real-world example demonstrating your understanding?

are very big values or very small or values that do not exist or Nan Value.It has a big effect on the mean and its effect is little on the material and mode.
Example: If we have values of 2000, 2200, 2500, 2700, 3000, 15000, the mean will be very high because of (15000) but the madian will not be affected


What’s the difference between population and sample? Do the same measurements (mean, mode, median) apply to both?

population: is all data , sample: is part of data.
You can make the same measurements on them but in the population the accuracy is high to include all the data but in the sample it is estimated and there might be a simple mistake.


What is the difference between a discrete and a continuous random variable?

discrete random variable: A variable takes a limited value from a set of integers,
continuous random variable: A variable that takes unlimited values and can be decimal or fractional


In normal distribution, what is the percentage of data falls within two standard deviations of the mean?

About 95% of the data falls within the range of two standard deviations from the mean in the normal distribution.

the values that have most frequency are 10,9,8 that will affect the mean,madian,mode
the mean will be high , the madian will not affected and mode is 10 the highest peak of distribution and high value


What do you know about Python’s containers?

python's containers are data structure used to store and aggregate data for example: lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets
lists: store ordered data and data can be different types also data is mutable you can change it.
tupls: tuples like lists but you can't change data.
dictionaries: store data in more organized way it stored in the form Key-Value paris u can use Key to get value.
sets: stored unordered data of only one type.

What does apply() method do?

it used with pandas and dataframes if you have Dataframe or table of data and u want to do an operation on each row or every elemnt 
instead looping each element , you use apply() method to save time and code.

How would you reverse a list in python in one line? (Don’t use reverse() method).

we can use slicing --> reversed_list=list[::-1]

Compare between continue, break and pass.

continue : used to skip one cycle
break: used to exit the loop
pass: it does nothing it used when you working on code and you want to leave block empty without causing any error

What is the output of this code? 
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
b=a
b[0]=11
print(a)
the output will be [11,2,3,4,5]
b has the same address of a in memory


What is the output of this function?
[1] [1,1] [1,1,1] in firt time the list by default is empty and every time you call function it append 1 at the end.

What do you know about Object Oriented Programming?
the idea of OOP that you divide your code into Classes and Objects each Class has methods and attributes to do specific task
Encapsulation: It means that you hide the internal details of the object and display only the needs that the user needs to see.
Inheritance: A new class can inherit from an existing variety and use or modify its data and functions
Polymorphism: The same function (Method) does different things depending on the object that uses it
Abstraction: Focus on what's important, and ignore the complicated details that you don't need to know

What do you know about Functional Programming?
I don't know to be honest.
